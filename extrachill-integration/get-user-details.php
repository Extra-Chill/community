/**
 * User Details API Migration Complete
 * [MULTISITE MIGRATION COMPLETED]
 *
 * REST API endpoint functionality has been migrated to native WordPress multisite functions
 * in the main extrachill theme. This file is preserved for reference but the endpoint has been removed.
 *
 * User details now handled by native multisite functions via:
 * - extrachill theme: inc/community/community-session.php
 * - Functions: preload_user_details()
 * - Uses native WordPress functions: is_user_logged_in(), wp_get_current_user()
